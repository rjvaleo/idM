/**
 * The MIDI readout, as a tracker.
 *
 * A row is one subdivision of the beat and every subdivision gets one, whether
 * or not a note lands in it. New rows arrive at the top and push the rest
 * down, a whole row at a time, so the movement is a clock tick rather than a
 * glide. Two notes a few ticks apart share a row instead of drawing on top of
 * each other, and a fast passage takes exactly as much space as a slow one —
 * the grid comes from the subdivision, not from how dense the music is.
 *
 * Two earlier models were wrong in opposite ways. A log appended a row per
 * event, so a bar of rests froze the display. Placing rows at their exact
 * position in beat space scrolled smoothly but spaced the music by its own
 * density, which is what made switching between fast and slow passages look
 * sloppy and let text overlap.
