 * property of the music, only of the 1986 product, and the engine has no reason
 * to know the number: a project carries as many Voices as its `voices` array is
 * long.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `voiceCount` field. A stored count can disagree with
 * the array it counts, and then every reader has to decide which to believe.
